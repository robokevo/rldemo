Project:
- package integration (vite?)
- linting
  - reserved word check?
  - dead code check?
- refactors:
  - split up 'settings' file/integrate into existing library files
  - is fastile fast enough for ascii video?
- branding:
  - vertical css text gradient, from white to brand blue/green

Stages:
- exit sanity checks
  -- clear placement (e.g. 'soft stone' if surrounded)
  -- check for entities above/below depth
  -- entity travel through exits
- divergent paths ala Spelunky
- de-center depths/reshape widths dynamically to avoid back/forth predictability
- region objects with:
  -- center/corner coordinates
  -- smart connections

Entities:
- status effects
- various detection styles
  -light/fov
  -hearing/smell, not seeing, render as '?'
    -- best hearing/smell as A* or fov comp
    -- cheap as line-of-sight?
  -line-of-sight/'night vision'
  -view angle
- factions
- distribute spawning through regions/away from player
- various default engagements e.g.
  -- mushrooms instant ko, message 'you pick the mushroom'

Tiles:
- have colors render via tile bg/fg
  -- save local copy of level colors
  -- shade walls, large entities/swarm
- load/unload tile func that has copy of ent
- flexible tiles that can switch from wall to floor
- highlight exit tile somehow (wall shading? different fg color?)
- hallucination effect - do math to fg/bg colors and alternate on turns

UI-panels:

Rendering individual panels:
-color:
 . default color or accent scheme that comes from levels? 
 - *projects need a color dict with preset schemes*
 - current structure:
  - primaryFG, primaryBG
  - secondaryFG, primaryBG
  - accentFG, accentBG
  - fg2/bg2, accent1/accent2 methods still need to be implemented
  - SHOULD NOT NEED MORE THAN 6 COLORS FOR MAIN UI
  - attenuate contrast within AAA guideline (7? c ratio)
-auto-gradient panel boarders for depth?
-panels register heights/widths to allow for 2 rows of auto align
-panel with a log object
 .descending darkened text to highlight most recent
