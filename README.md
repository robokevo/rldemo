# Javascript Roguelike Demo (extreeeemely demo)
## aka Moon Minerzz
### Â© 2019 robokevo

A modern attempt to recreate the now defunct Coding Cookies roguelike tutorial that leverages the rot.js library (and more recent developments in javascript).

#### Roadmap

##### ~~0.1~~:

It has the symptoms of a game. It's enough of a proof of concept to at least give a picture of what the end product will look like. Buggy as hell and pointless to play longer than 2 minutes; expect that for the next year or so.

##### 0.2:

Finish all tutorial chapters + look into original java tutorial for other ideas; refine ui and basic input support.

##### 0.3:

Refine level randomization and features to allow for complexity and puzzles.

##### 0.4:

Refine colors, lighting, and entity interactions.

##### 0.5:

Item + skill systems; deeper item + world integration

##### 0.6:

Proper module integration, look into fastiles js libray for tile rendering.

##### 0.7:

Sound + narrative elements; expand input types.

##### 0.8:

Explore local features (local storage, workers)

##### 0.9:

Robust device support; check for other platform integrations (e.g. itch.io)

##### 1.0:

I speedrun it on twitch

Everything subject to change as I have a full time job and two cats that keep trying to eat plastic for some reason.
